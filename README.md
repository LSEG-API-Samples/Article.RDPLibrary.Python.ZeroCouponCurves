Exploring RDP Instrument Pricing Analytics API for Zero Coupon Curves

The example uses the config.cfg which will need to be populated with your credentials 
e.g. for Refinitiv Data Platform session:
**[platform]**  
**app_key = 0abcdd13bf27478987d1c75f2c5fd8fc469123b2**  
**user = GE-A-01234567-8-9101**  
**password = thisisMyDummyPassword12345#**  

OR for Desktop Session (Eikon or Workspace)
**[desktop]**  
**app_key = 0abcdd13bf27478987d1c75f2c5fd8fc469123b2**  

(The above are all dummy values)  

For a desktop session - i.e. connecting to your locally running Eikon Desktop or Refinitiv Workspace, you only need to supply an AppKey - which you can generate using the AppKey generator built into Eikon and Workspace - search for AppKey in the Eikon or Workspace

For a Platform Session you will also need a MachineID and password.
The MachineID will be provided in a Welcome Email generated by your Account team when you become a Refinitiv Customer or sign up for a Trial Account. The Welcome Email will also contain a link for setting your Password.
If you don't have Eikon or Workspace you can generate an AppKey using the AppKey Generator at https://api.refinitiv.com/ (click the top left corner once logged in).
